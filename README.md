## Forensic-Analysis-Local-Incident-Response

**Forensic analysis** in local incident response involves a structured investigation of digital evidence following a cybersecurity incident. The goal is to identify, preserve, analyze, and present evidence to determine the cause, scope, and impact of the breach, enabling organizations to respond effectively to incidents such as data breaches, malware infections, or unauthorized access.

The forensic analysis process in local incident response typically includes the following steps:
---
## 1. Identification
 In this phase, potential sources of evidence and relevant data are identified. This involves determining which systems, devices, and data sources were involved in the incident, such as hard drives, memory dumps, and network logs.
---
## 2. Preservation
 The integrity of the identified evidence is maintained by creating forensic copies and documenting the chain of custody. To ensure the evidence is admissible in legal proceedings, it must remain unaltered, and the analysis reproducible by third parties.
---
## 3. Analysis
 The collected evidence is thoroughly examined to reconstruct the incident. Using forensic tools, investigators analyze files, logs, and system data to uncover patterns, identify the attack vector, assess compromised systems, and evaluate the overall impact of the incident.
---
## 4. Reporting
 The findings from the forensic analysis are documented clearly and comprehensively. This report records the evidence, methodologies, and conclusions, and is prepared for stakeholders, legal processes, and future reference.
