## Identification: 
- In a forensic case study involving a data breach, memory dumps and disk images were identified and collected as key sources of evidence. The memory dump was captured using Belkasoft RAM Capture, while disk images were acquired using a hardware write-blocker to prevent any data modification.
--
## Preservation:
- To ensure the integrity of the evidence, MD5 hashes were calculated for both the memory dump and disk images at the time of collection. Forensic copies of the evidence were then mounted on a forensic analysis workstation, where the hashes were re-calculated and verified to confirm that the integrity of the evidence remained intact throughout the process.
